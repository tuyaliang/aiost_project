Socionext mlb01 PWM controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "socionext,mlb01-pwm"
 - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
	The first one is the apb registers and the second is the DMA area
	used for motor control / sequencer mode.
 - clocks: phandle and clock specifier of the PWM reference clock
 - #pwm-cells: must be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory
   for a description of the cell format.

Optional properties:
 - base-rate: set the rate of the clock to this at probe

Example:
        pwm0: pwm@1e120000 {
                compatible = "socionext,mlb01-pwm";
                reg = <0x1e001000 0x400>, <0x1e120000 0x10000>;
                clocks = <&rclk>;
                /* all the pwm units share the same clock */
                base-rate = <13500000>; /* ask for this input rate */
                #pwm-cells = <3>;
        };
