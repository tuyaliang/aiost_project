* Fujistu OGMA Ethernet Controller IP

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "socionext,ogma"
- reg: Address and length of the register sets, the first is the main
	registers, then the rdlar and tdlar regions for the SoC
- interrupts: Should contain ethernet controller interrupt
- clocks: phandle to any clocks to be switched by runtime_pm
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- max-speed: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- max-frame-size: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory, if 9000 or
	above jumbo frames are enabled
- local-mac-address: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- phy-handle: phandle to select child phy

For the child phy

- compatible "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22" is needed
- device_type "ethernet-phy"
- reg: phy address


Example:
	eth0: f_taiki {
                compatible = "socionext,ogma";
		reg = <0 0x31600000 0x10000>, <0 0x31618000 0x4000>, <0 0x3161c000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <0 163 0x4>;
		clocks = <&clk_alw_0_8>;
		phy-mode = "rgmii";
		max-speed = <1000>;
		max-frame-size = <9000>;
		local-mac-address = [ a4 17 31 00 00 ed ];
		phy-handle = <&ethphy0>;

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		ethphy0: ethernet-phy@1 {
			device_type = "ethernet-phy";
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
